# ToDoListApp


### To Do List App is a full fledged iPhone app built using Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode. The app has a beautiful UI/UX design. I have integrated Google Firebase as a backend for the app. This backend will let the user Register and Log In to the new app and save users data into a database.

- The app has a Launch Screen, a Login Page to sign in for an existing user and a Register page to create an account for the new user.
- After signing in, the user can add new to do list items by clicking the plus icon on home screen and then adding the title and selecting the due date and time for item and clicking on save button.
- The user can also mark the done items checked by clicking the check mark/tick icon or delete them by swiping the item to the left and clicking on the delete button.
- The app has a navigation bar with Home and Profile buttons. On Profile page, the user can view his/her personal details and also sign out from app by clicking on Log Out button.
  
### Through this project, I have learnt about the details of working with data in a declarative UI framework like SwiftUI and leveraged best practices with ViewModels, StateObjects, Bindings, making components like headers, Calendars, and buttons, more reusable.
